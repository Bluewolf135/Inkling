// cannot be undone.

// What is changing is that the refusal used to be the end of the road. There
// was no way out from inside Obsidian — the user was left hand-editing JSON —
// and the banner was decided once when the block rendered and never revisited,
// so it outlived the condition that caused it. Both showed up together after a
// LiveSync conflict on a note whose blocks turned out to be perfectly healthy.
