// A block used to be written as one line of compact JSON, on the reasoning
// that a few hundred lines of formatted JSON per drawing would swamp the
// writing around it. The cost of that was not measured until it was found in
// use: a page of handwriting is a line of 164,799 characters, and Obsidian's
// Live Preview cannot edit a document shaped like that. Typing anywhere in
// the note lagged.
//
// Confirmed by experiment rather than reasoned about. A copy of the note with
// the fence language changed so the plugin never ran was just as laggy, which
// ruled out anything Inkling executes; the same copy with the JSON wrapped
// was smooth. Source mode was always smooth, which is what pointed at the
// rendering pass rather than at CodeMirror's handling of long lines.
//
// So the JSON is wrapped. It is still one JSON document — whitespace between
// tokens means nothing to a parser — and every path that reads a block
// already joins the fence's lines before parsing, so nothing else changes.
