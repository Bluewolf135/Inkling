// Reconciling a block whose file changed underneath the view holding it.
//
// A block flushes any pending write when it is torn down, and teardown often
// happens *because* the file changed — a sync landing inside the debounce is
// exactly that case. The write used to overwrite whatever the fence held, so
// the other device's strokes went silently. Refusing instead would lose ours
// rather than theirs, which is not better.
//
// A three-way merge is well defined here, and that is not luck: all three
// sides are in hand — what this view read (base), what it holds (ours), and
// what the file says now (theirs) — and annotations are independent records
// with stable ids. There is no ordering constraint between them beyond paint
// order, and nothing to reconcile inside one.
//
// Pure, and its own module, because it is the part worth testing
// exhaustively and the save path around it is the part that has already
// produced two data-loss bugs.

// Whether two annotations would be written the same way.
//
// Compared as they serialize rather than field by field: a difference that
// does not survive the round trip into the note is not a difference anyone
// can see, and coordinates are rounded on the way out. Comparing raw objects
// would call a stroke "changed" because a float moved in the twelfth
// decimal, and would then prefer our copy over theirs for no reason.
