// The single chokepoint every binary write to the vault goes through.
//
// Two guards, either of which leaves the file on disk exactly as it was:
//
// 1. **Before.** A buffer that isn't a PDF, or is implausibly short, never
//    reaches the file. writeDocument already verifies structure for the
//    annotation path (see pdf/annotationWriterCore.ts), but "Add page" does
//    its own read-modify-write and had nothing under it at all.
// 2. **After.** The file's size on disk is compared against what was
//    written. A write cut short — the app killed mid-save, which mobile
//    OSes do to backgrounded apps aggressively — leaves a shorter file, and
//    this is what notices. The caller keeps its pages dirty and retries.
//
// **What this is not, yet.** The design called for an atomic replace: write
// to a scratch path outside the sync tree, then rename over the target, so
// an interrupted write cannot damage the original at all. That needs a
// real-device spike first — three things have to hold, and none can be
// checked from here:
//
//   - that `adapter.writeBinary`/`rename` work inside a dot-folder on
//     Android as well as desktop;
//   - that a rename into the vault tree updates Obsidian's own file record
//     and fires its file events, since a write that bypasses those may
//     never reach a sync plugin at all — a silently unsynced edit would be
//     a worse failure than the one being fixed;
//   - that Self-hosted LiveSync ignores the scratch folder by default.
//
// Until those are confirmed, this is the fallback the design named: keep
// the verification, write through the Vault API so events fire normally,
// and give up only the interrupted-write protection specifically. The
// after-write size check recovers most of what that would have bought,
// because the damage becomes loud instead of silent.

// Every PDF starts with this, per the spec's own header requirement. Cheap
// to check and catches the failure that matters: handing modifyBinary a
// detached, empty, or wrong buffer, which would replace a textbook with
// nothing.

// ---- Appending ----

// The append path's own version of the two guards above, because neither
// survives unchanged.
//
// `looksLikePdf` cannot apply to an appendix: an update section does not start
// with `%PDF-`. What replaces it is the other end — an appendix that does not
// finish at `%%EOF` is not an update section, whatever else it is.
//
// And the after-write size check has to be told the base length, because for
// an append the expected size is *original + appended* rather than the number
// of bytes handed over.
//
// The check with no counterpart in the replacement path is the one *before*
// the write. **An append onto a file that changed since we read it produces a
// corrupt PDF**, where a full rewrite would merely lose the other change.
// That is the single place incremental save is more dangerous than what it
// replaces, and it is a live risk in a Self-hosted LiveSync vault. On a
// mismatch the correct action is not to retry — it is to fall back to a full
// rewrite from a fresh read, which is what the caller does.
