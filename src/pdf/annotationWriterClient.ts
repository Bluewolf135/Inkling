// (`app://<vaultId>`) distinct from the main window's (`app://obsidian.md`),
// and constructing a Worker from a script on that other origin throws
// SecurityError outright — for a classic worker just as much as a module
// one, so it isn't a module-only restriction to dodge by changing bundle
// format. Building the worker from a same-origin blob: URL containing the
// code itself sidesteps the cross-origin question entirely, with no
// dynamic import of a foreign URL involved either.
//
// A provider rather than the text itself so the (sizable) bundle is only
// ever read for someone who actually annotates something, not at plugin
// load; cached below after the first read. A module singleton because
// PdfAnnotateView, which needs this, has no handle on the Plugin instance
// to resolve it itself.
