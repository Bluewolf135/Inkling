// Inkling already parses every file twice on open: once with `pdf.js`, to

// catches exactly that case. Disagreement means `pdf-lib`'s model of this
// file is incomplete, and every save would serialize from that incomplete
// model — so the file opens read-only instead.
//
// This module holds the shape both sides produce and the comparison
// between them. Neither parser is imported by the pdf.js side; it builds
// the same structure from its own API (see src/pdfView.ts).
