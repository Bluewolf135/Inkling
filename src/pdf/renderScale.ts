// How large a PDF page is laid out, and how densely its canvas is backed.
//
// The pure half of what pdfView.ts does when it renders a page — separated
// for the same reason textLines.ts is: it can be reasoned about and tested
// without a PDFPageProxy, a viewport or a DOM around it.
//
// The bug this exists to fix, measured in the running app against Obsidian's
// own PDF view, same file and same 1276px pane:
//
//     core `pdf` view   1224 x 1509 backing, 1224 x 1509 displayed
//     annotate view      810 x  999 backing,  810 x  999 displayed
//
// Both are pixel-for-pixel at their own size, so neither is being resampled.
// The annotate view was simply drawing the page two thirds the size — and so
// at two thirds the resolution — because it laid every page out at a flat
// 1.5x its size in PDF points and never looked at how much room it actually
// had. pdf.js's own viewer fits the page to the pane. That difference is the
// whole of "the quality of the PDF went down when I entered annotation
// mode": nothing had blurred, there was just a third less page there.

// The layout scale used before a page can be measured — the first-page
// estimate that reserves placeholder space at open time, and the fallback if
// the container reports no width at all. The old fixed render scale, kept
// only for those two cases.
export const RENDER_SCALE = 1.5;

// The hard ceiling on any render, zoom included. A page canvas costs four
// bytes a pixel and the view keeps several pages alive at once (see
// PAGE_RETAIN_MARGIN), so this is a memory limit rather than a quality one.
export const MAX_RENDER_SCALE = 6;

// A floor, so that a pane reporting some implausibly small width cannot
// produce a page rendered down to nothing. Deliberately far below
// RENDER_SCALE: rendering *below* the old fixed scale is correct whenever
// the page is displayed smaller than that, and forcing 1.5 there would back
// the canvas larger than the box it is shown in, which is not extra detail —
// it is a downscale, and a resampled page reads softer than one rendered at
// the size it is actually drawn at.

// density, and on an ordinary 1x screen the two are the same number.
// Applying density here is what src/markdown/inkBlock.ts has always done for
